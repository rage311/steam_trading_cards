You know those useless trading cards that sit in your Steam inventory that lack enough value to even be worth taking the time to list manually on the Steam marketplace?  This app is here to alleviate that pain and still earn the market value for each of the cards.

Warning: there are probably bugs.  Use at your own risk.

Also, there is still lots of debugging output.


Usage:

Edit the config.toml file with your actual user name, password, and Steam ID.

`cargo run [-- -n]`

-n / --dry-run shows you what the run would've looked like without listing any assets.
